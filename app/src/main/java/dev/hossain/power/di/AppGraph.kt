/**
 * Metro dependency graph for the application, which includes all necessary bindings and providers.
 *
 * This is the root dependency graph (component) for the application. It is scoped to [AppScope]
 * which makes all bindings in this graph singletons within the application lifecycle.
 *
 * Key Metro features used:
 * - [DependencyGraph]: Marks this as a Metro dependency graph (similar to Dagger's @Component)
 * - [SingleIn]: Declares the scope for this graph (AppScope in this case)
 * - [Provides]: Functions that provide dependencies to the graph
 * - [DependencyGraph.Factory]: Factory interface for creating the graph with runtime inputs
 * - Multibindings: `activityProviders` is a map multibinding for Activity injection
 *
 * See https://zacsweers.github.io/metro/latest/dependency-graphs/ for more information on dependency graphs.
 * See https://zacsweers.github.io/metro/latest/scopes/ for more information on scopes.
 * See https://zacsweers.github.io/metro/latest/bindings/ for more information on bindings and multibindings.
