Power Button – Screen Lock Assist helps you control your phone when the physical power button is broken or hard to use.

Android does not allow apps to open the system power menu or shut down the device. This app provides safe, approved alternatives using built-in system features.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✨ WHAT YOU CAN DO

• Lock your screen instantly
• Turn the screen off
• Access power and system settings
• Open the emergency dialer

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🔘 HOW IT WORKS

A small floating button acts as a software power key. Position it anywhere on your screen.

• Tap the button to open quick power actions
• Long-press to instantly lock the screen
• Drag to reposition the button
• The button snaps to screen edges for convenience

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

⚙️ CUSTOMIZATION

• Choose button size (small, medium, large)
• Set long-press action preference
• Position button anywhere on screen

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🔒 PRIVACY & PERMISSIONS

This app uses Accessibility services only to perform screen actions requested by the user.

• No personal data is collected
• No screen content is read
• No usage tracking
• No ads

We take your privacy seriously. The accessibility permission is used solely to lock your screen and turn off the display – nothing else.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ℹ️ IMPORTANT LIMITATIONS

Due to Android security restrictions, this app cannot:
• Open the real Android power menu
• Shut down your device
• Restart your device

This is an Android platform limitation for security reasons, not a limitation of this app. We provide safe alternatives for the most common power button uses.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

👥 WHO IS THIS FOR?

• Users with broken or damaged power buttons
• Users with physical disabilities
• Elderly users who find small buttons difficult
• Anyone who prefers on-screen controls

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Designed for accessibility, simplicity, and reliability.

## ♿ Accessibility Declaration

### Declaration Questions & Answers

**Q: Does your app use the Accessibility API?**
```
Yes
```

**Q: Why does your app need accessibility permissions?**
```
This app provides a software power button replacement for users with 
broken or hard-to-use physical power buttons. The Accessibility Service 
is used to perform screen lock and screen-off actions when the user 
taps the floating power button. This is the core functionality of the 
app and directly assists users with accessibility needs.
```

**Q: What accessibility features does your app provide?**
```
- Floating on-screen button for users who cannot use physical power button
- One-tap screen lock without needing hardware button
- Screen off functionality for users with motor disabilities
- Large, customizable touch targets
- Alternative to physical button interaction
```

**Q: Does your app use accessibility to read screen content?**
```
No. The app explicitly sets canRetrieveWindowContent="false" in the 
accessibility service configuration. No screen content is ever read, 
captured, or processed.
```

**Q: Does your app collect data using accessibility?**
```
No. The Accessibility Service is used only to perform user-initiated 
actions (lock screen, turn off display). No data is collected, stored, 
or transmitted.
```

### FAQ (for support responses)

**Q: Why can't the app shut down my phone?**
```
Android does not allow apps to shut down or restart devices for security 
reasons. This is a platform limitation. Our app provides alternatives 
for the most common power button uses: locking the screen and turning 
off the display.
```

**Q: Why does the app need Accessibility permission?**
```
The Accessibility permission allows the app to perform the lock screen 
action when you tap the floating button. This is the only way Android 
allows apps to lock the screen. We don't read any screen content or 
collect any data.
```

**Q: The floating button disappeared. How do I get it back?**
```
Open the app and toggle the floating button switch on the home screen. 
If that doesn't work, check that the "Draw over other apps" permission 
is still enabled in your device settings.
```

**Q: Does this app work when the screen is off?**
```
The floating button is visible when your screen is on. To turn the 
screen back on with a broken power button, you can use features like 
double-tap to wake, fingerprint sensor, or scheduled alarms.
```
